Please see the Readme in the parent directory for further information. The bylaws are valid for the [Codeberg e.V.

## Preamble

The creation of Free Software is experiencing an unbroken boom due to the general availability of the Internet and the resulting network effects. The number of people involved in development of Free Software is growing exponentially. Effective collaboration in larger, international and geographically separated groups has only become possible with the introduction of new software tools and collaboration platforms.

While the dominating software tools that made this collaboration possible were developed as Free and Open Software (a good example is "GIT"), the succeeding collaboration tools are proprietary online services of commercial companies, which are mostly operating under US law. This lead to the paradox situation that millions of volunteers create free knowledge, text contributions and software of immeasurable value while handing over its control to these commercial platforms.

The open source code which is developed freely and for public benefit and makes modern communication on the Internet and our connected life possible, and even the products of publicly funded research, are fed into private and commercially operated platforms, whose software and continued existence cannot be controlled from outside, whose control is not even attempted.

As Codeberg e.V., we are convinced that the process of software creation, its documentation and communication, in which developers of Free Software participate deserve a likewise free and non-profit operating platform, to guarantee the openness and continued availability of free software in the future.

Therefore, the purpose of Codeberg e.V. is the creation and operation of a free collaboration platform for the creation, archiving and preservation of code and the documents of its development processes, as well as the improvement, customization and integration of already existing free software tools for making this platform possible. Dependencies on external and proprietary services for the operation of the platform are specifically avoided in order to not endanger the independence, autonomy and existence of the platform.
