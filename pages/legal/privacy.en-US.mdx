<br />

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.

<br />

**<h4>Personal information provided by you.</h4>**
<br />

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:

* names
<br />

<br />
* passwords

<br />
* cookies and similar technologies

<br />

**Sensitive Information.** We do not process sensitive information.
<br />

**OAuth2 Login Data.** We may provide you with the option to register with us using your existing OAuth2 account details, like your Github, Google, or other OAuth2 account. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect the information described in the section called "[HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR OAUTH 2 LOGINS?](#oauth2)" below.
<br />

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

<br />

**<h4>Information automatically collected</h4>**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services._
<br />

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
<br />

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our [Cookie Notice](/legal/cookies).
<br />

The information we collect includes:

* _Log and Usage Data._ Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).

* _Device Data._ We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.

* _Location Data._ We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

<br /> 

### <a id="legalbases"></a>**3\. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?**
<br />

_**In Short:** We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests._
<br />

_**If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.**_
<br />

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

* **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click [here](#withdrawconsent) to learn more.

* **Performance of a Contract.** We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.

* **Legitimate Interests.** We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:

* Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services

* Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users

* Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users

* Support our marketing activities

* Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities

* Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience

* **Legal Obligations.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.  
    
* **Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
<br />

**_If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you._**
<br />

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click [here](#withdrawconsent) to learn more.
<br />

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

* If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way

* For investigations and fraud detection and prevention

* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met

* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim

* For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin

* If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse

* If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province

* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records

* If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced

* If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes

* If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

<br /> 

### <a id="whoshare"></a>**4\. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**
<br />  

**_In Short:_** _We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following categories of third parties._
<br />

**Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.** We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("**third parties**") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:

* Cloud Computing Services

* Data Analytics Services

* Data Storage Service Providers

* Finance & Accounting Tools

* Government Entities

* Git Services

* Communication & Collaboration Tools
<br />

We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

* **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

* **Affiliates.** We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this privacy notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.

* **Security Purposes.** If you are a member of an Organization (an entity of two or more members), Nitehub may share your information associated with that Organization with an owner and/or administrator of the Organization who has agreed to the [Terms of Service](/legal/tos) or applicable customer agreements, to the extent that such information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.

* **Other Users.** When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions, or other content to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas of the Services, such personal information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the Services in perpetuity. If you interact with other users of our Services and register for our Services through a social network (such as Github), your contacts on the social network will see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services, and view your profile.

<br />

### <a id="cookies"></a>**5\. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information._
<br />

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our [Cookie Notice](/legal/cookies).

<br />  

### <a id="oauth2"></a>**6\. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR OAUTH 2 LOGINS?**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _If you choose to register or log in to our Services using an OAuth2 account, we may have access to certain information about you._
<br />

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party OAuth2 account details (like your Github or Gitlab logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your OAuth2 provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the OAuth2 provider concerned, but will often include your username, email address, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such an OAuth2 platform.
<br />

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party OAuth2 provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

<br />

### <a id="intltransfers"></a>**7\. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own._
<br />

Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "[WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?](#whoshare)" above), in the United States, and other countries.
<br /> 

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
<br />  

**<h4>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</h4>**
<br />

We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the _European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses_ for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

<br />

### <a id="inforetain"></a>**8\. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law._
<br />

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user's account. Feel free to contact our support to request erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.
<br />

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
<br />

**Note:** _The email address you have supplied via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. If you choose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history — the Git software is designed to maintain a record — but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record._

<br />

### <a id="infosafe"></a>**9\. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._
<br />

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
<br />

Please note that to the extent above, we enforce a written security information program, which:

* aligns with industry recognized frameworks;

* includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our users' data;

* is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of Nitehub's business operations;

* includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and

* complies with applicable information security-related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where Nitehub does business.
<br />

In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected users within 72 hours (3 days) of breach.
<br />

**Note:** _Transmission of data on Nitehub is encrypted using **SSH**, **HTTPS (TLS)**, and git repository content is encrypted at REST. We host the Services on [Google CLoud Platform](cloud.google.com), which provides data centers with high levels of physical and network security. But as stated above, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information._

<br />

### <a id="privacyrights"></a>**10\. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time._
<br />

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact)" below.
<br />

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
<br />

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: [https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index\_en.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm).
<br />  

If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: [https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).
<br />

<a id="withdrawconsent"></a>**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact)" below.
<br />

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
<br />

**Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact)" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
<br />

**Data Portability:** As a Nitehub user, you can always take your data with you. You can clone your repositories to your computer, or you can [perform migrations using the provided interfaces](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/migrations-interfaces/), for example.
<br />

**Account Information**
<br />

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:

* Log in to your account settings and update your user account.

* Contact us using the contact information provided.
<br />

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
<br />  

**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). For further information, please see our [Cookie Notice](/legal/cookies).
<br />

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at [policies.nitehub@gmail.com](mailto:policies.nitehub@gmail.com).

<br />

### <a id="DNT"></a>**11\. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**
<br />

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a _Do-Not-Track ("DNT")_ feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

<br />

### <a id="caresidents"></a>**12\. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?**
<br />

**_In Short:_** _Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information._
<br />

**California Civil Code Section 1798.83**, also known as the _"Shine The Light"_ law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
<br />

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).
<br />

**CCPA Privacy Notice**
<br />

**Verification process**
<br />

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
<br />

We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

### <a id="repoaccess"></a>**13\. ACCESS TO REPOSITORY CONTENTS**
<br />

Our employees do not access private repositories unless required to for security purposes, for support, to maintain integrity of the Services, or to comply with our legal obligations. While we don't generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers and your content to detect tokens or security signatures, known malwares, or child exploitation imagery.
<br />

If your repository is public, anyone may view its contents. If you include private, confidential or personal information, such as email addresses or passwords, in your public repository, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.

<br />

### <a id="publicinfo"></a>**14\. ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION**
<br />

Many of our services and feature are public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or repositories or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing Nitehub information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape Nitehub and compile data as well.
<br />

Personal information associated with your content could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Nitehub data. If you do not want your personal information to appear in third parties' compilations of Nitehub data, please do not make your personal information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your account settings and in your git commit settings.
<br />

If you would like to compile Nitehub's data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding scraping and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing personal information you gather for the purpose for which our users authorized it. For example, where a Nitehub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any personal information you have gathered from Nitehub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from Nitehub or Nitehub users.
<br />

In similar fashion, projects on Nitehub may include publicly available personal information collected as part of the collaborative events.

<br />

### <a id="organizations"></a>**15\. ACCESS TO INFORMATION BY ORGANIZATIONS**
<br />

If you collaborate on or become a member of an Organization, then its account owners may receive your personal information. When you accept an invitation to an Organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see. If you accept an invitation to an Organization with a verified domain, then the owners of that Organization will be able to see your full email address(es) within that Organization's verified domain(s).
<br />

Please note that Nitehub may share your information with the owner of the Organization you are a member of, to the extent that your personal information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.
<br />

If you collaborate with or become a member of an account that has agreed to a _"Data Protection Addendum (DPA)"_ instead of this privacy notice, then that DPA governs in the event of conflicts between this privacy notice and the DPA with respect to your activity in the account.
<br />

Please contact the Organization account owners for more information about how they might process your personal information in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete the personal information stored in the account.

<br />

### <a id="policyupdates"></a>**16\. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?**
<br />

_**In Short:** Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws._
<br />

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
