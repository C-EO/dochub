<Steps>
### Navigate to Nitehub.
  
Visit [Nitehub](https://git.c-eo.repl.co) and click on the "Register" link in the top-right corner of your screen.
 
import registerAccountImg from '../../.github/screenshot.png' 

<Screenshot src={registerAccountImg} alt="Register Link" />
  
### Register yourself.
  
Once on the "Register" page, you will see a form in which you must fill your name, email address, and a strong password. (You'll also have to complete the `reCAPTCHA` challenge provided by 'hCaptcha'.)

### Confirm your identity.

On clicking the "Register Account" button, you'll be emailed a link with which to activate the account. (Please not that the link is valid for **'3 hours'**)
