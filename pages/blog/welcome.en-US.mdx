Nitehub is an **OSS (Open Source Software)** platform designed on Gitea used for collaborating on code. It is a community fork of Gitea designed with more features and can run on any platform using low specs.

As Kahlil Gibran wrote about children (Quoted from the Gitea blog):

> Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

Nitehub was founded by [C-EO](https://github.com/C-EO). Though he is the rightful owner and has absolute admin control and power, Nitehub has 3 owners which are elected yearly and an open number of maintainers who decide with a simple voting model which contributions get accepted and who will play the owner role. Anyone with at least 6 contributions accepted can apply to become a maintainer.

If you think that the Nitehub website has limitations, you can always setup your own instance by making sure you have the below prerequisites.

## System Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi 3 is powerful enough to run Nitehub for small workloads.
- 2 CPU cores and 1GB RAM is typically sufficient for small teams/projects.
- Nitehub should be run with a dedicated non-root system account on UNIX-type systems.
  - Note: Nitehub manages the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Running Nitehub as a regular user could break that user's ability to log in.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.0.0 or later is required.
  - [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) will be available if enabled and if your Git version is >= 2.1.2
  - Git commit-graph rendering will be enabled automatically if your Git version is >= 2.18
