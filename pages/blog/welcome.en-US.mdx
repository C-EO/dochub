Nitehub is an **OSS (Open Source Software)** platform designed on Gitea used for collaborating on code. It is a community fork of Gitea designed with more features and can run on any platform using low specs.

As Kahlil Gibran wrote about children (Quoted from the Gitea blog):

> Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Lifeâ€™s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

Nitehub was founded by [C-EO](https://github.com/C-EO). Though he is the rightful owner and has absolute admin control and power, Nitehub has 3 owners which are elected yearly and an open number of maintainers who decide with a simple voting model which contributions get accepted and who will play the owner role. Anyone with at least 6 contributions accepted can apply to become a maintainer.

If you think that the Nitehub website has limitations, you can always setup your own instance by making sure you have the below prerequisites.

## System Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi 3 is powerful enough to run Nitehub for small workloads.
- 2 CPU cores and 1GB RAM is typically sufficient for small teams/projects.
- Nitehub should be run with a dedicated non-root system account on UNIX-type systems.
  - Note: Nitehub manages the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Running Nitehub as a regular user could break that user's ability to log in.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.0.0 or later is required.
  - [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) will be available if enabled and if your Git version is >= 2.1.2
  - Git commit-graph rendering will be enabled automatically if your Git version is >= 2.18
